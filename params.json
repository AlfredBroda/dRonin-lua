Connect the Arducopter with a RS232 TTL level converter (not need to be a FrSky, a cheaper one from EBay also works fine (watch for correct specifications)) and connect RS232 TTL level converter with your FrSky Receiver\r\n2. Activate the FrSky D protocol in the parameters for the appropriate port. Baute rate 9kbs\r\n\r\n## Flight controller S-port Setup (X-receiver with Arducopter V3.3)\r\n1. Connect the Pixhawk with a RS232 TTL level converter (not need to be a FrSky, a cheaper one from EBay (MAX3232CSE also works fine & is better to solder) and connect RS232 TTL level converter with your FrSky Receiver\r\n2. Buy the FrSky SPC cable, but its only one normal diode and you can soldering the diode direct to the RS 232 TTL converter like https://goo.gl/y9XCq8 and doesn’t need the SPC Adapter\r\n3. Activate the FrSky S protocol in the parameters* for the appropriate port. Baute rate: 57kbs *(APMPlaner2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Taranis Setup OpenTX 2.1.6 or newer\r\n1. Make sure you have LUA-Scripting enabled in companion\r\n2. Download the scripts folder from here and copy to the SD card root\r\n3. Optional: Edit with a txt Editor the Downloaded Script to Change the Setup to you own Wishes\r\n3. Start your Taranis, go into your desired Model Settings by short pressing the Menu button\r\n4. Navigate to the last Page by long pressing the page button\r\n5. Delete all Sensors\r\n6. Discovery new Sensors\r\n7. There will be a lot of sensors listed depending on your receiver (d8r, d4r, x8r etc.)\r\n8. Recommend is to check if the sensors Name correct. \r\n9. Set this lua script as Telemetry screen.\r\n\r\n### Sensor Name (case sensitive!)\r\n* VFAS -> is the Lipo Voltage\r\n* Alt -> is the Baro Altitude\r\n* Curr -> Current drain\r\n* Gspd -> GPS Speed\r\n* Hdg -> Compass Direction\r\n* Tmp1 -> Flight mode (small Numbers)\r\n* Tmp2 -> GPS Fix (something like 103 for 10 satellites’ and 3d fix or 93 for 9 satellites’ and 3d fix)\r\n* RSSI -> Rssi Value\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using:\r\nPush in the Normal Taranis Screen Long the Page Button to see the LuaPilot Telemetry screens.\r\nIf you want to Reset LuaPilot because you have a new Home Position or reset you Battery Consume or what else Push long (Menu) in the LuaPilot Screen.\r\n\r\n##useful links\r\n1. http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-optional-hardware/common-telemetry-landingpage/common-frsky-telemetry/ (How to connect your Converter)\r\n\r\n##LuaPilot Script Download\r\nhttps://github.com/ilihack/LuaPilot_Taranis_Telemetry/archive/master.zip","google":"UA-69931607-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
